# Smart_Water_Treatment
This Smart Water Treatment system uses an ESP8266, turbidity and pH sensors, fuzzy logic, and Blynk IoT. It monitors water quality in real-time and automatically controls a servo valve based on the clarity and acidity levels. Readings are shown on an LCD and sent to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.
